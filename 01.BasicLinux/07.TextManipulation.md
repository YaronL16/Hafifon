### Goals
- The trainee will understand how to read, write and edit text in files

### Tasks
- Read about the following commands:
  - `echo`
  - `cat`
  - `grep` only line with word X
  - `cut` print selected parts of file
  - `uniq` no duplicate lines
  - `sort` sort lines of text files
  - `wc` count number of.. ( wc -l is lines, wc -c is characters)
  - `head` output the first part of files (-n X for number of lines)
  - `tail` opposite of head command
  - `awk` awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt , awk '{print $0}'
  - `sed` replace all occurences -- sed -i 's/b/a/g' test
  - `more` display text one screen at a time
  - `less` like more but with more (nice one) features like backwards navigation
- Use the command `sudo yum install -y words` to install a words file. It is now located at `/usr/share/dict/words`
- Display the top 27 lines of the words file -- head -n 27 /usr/share/dict/words

- Display the bottom 30 lines of the words file -- tail -n 30 /usr/share/dict/words

- Which flag is needed in order to open a file using tail in a continus mode? -- -f
- List the number of lines of the words file -- wc -l /usr/share..
- Print the words file to screen but change every occurence of `A` to `Alpha` -- sed 's/A/Alpha/g' /usr/share/dict/words
- Print the the screen only the first column of the file `/etc/fstab` using both `cut` and `awk` -- awk '{print $1}' /etc/fstab
, cut -d' ' -f1 /etc/fstab
- What is the difference between `more` and `less`? less has more features like backwards scrolling
- Print to the screen only the lines that contain the string `abc` (from the words file) -- grep abc /usr/share/dict/words
