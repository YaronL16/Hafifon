### Goals
- The trainee will understand how to handle files
- The trainee will understand how to find the location of files
- The trainee will understand what links are and how to use them

### Tasks
- Read about to following linux commands:
  - `cp` -- copy (cp source dest)
  - `mv` -- move files (and rename)
  - `rm` -- remove files or directories
  - `which` -- full path of shell commands
  - `locate` -- search a prebuilt databse for a file
  - `find` -- search filesystem
  - `ln` -- create hardlink by default, -s for softlink
- Which binary file executes when running the `lsb_release` command? -- no such command found, but anyways which ls - /usr/bin/ls
- Find the words file using the `find` command -- find /usr -name words
- List all the files that are bigger than 10MB inside the /boot directory -- find /boot -type f -size +10M
- Read about inodes and explain what inodes are -- a unique number representing a file/directory in that filesystem, all inode numbers are stored in a table, allowing the file system to easily calculate the offsets and be in control of the files.
- Explain the difference between hard link and soft link -- a hardlink is linked to the file's inode, so if the original file is deleted, the link can still let us access the data because the data still exists on the hd and wasnt overwritten, on the other hand a softlink only links to the 'name' of the file, as a logical link, once the original file is deleted the link is broken.
- How can we find the inode of a specific file? --ls -li
- What is the difference between find and locate? -- locate searches in a prebuilt database, find searches in the whole filesystem
- How can you copy an entire directory while also keeping the ownership and mode of the files? using the -p flag (cp -p)
